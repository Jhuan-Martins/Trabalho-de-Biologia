      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The plant cell is the structural and functional unit of organisms in the Plantae kingdom. Unlike the animal cell, it has unique structures that allow photosynthesis, water storage, and support for the plant.</p>
      <p>These cells are fundamental for ecological balance, as they produce oxygen and serve as the basis for the food chain. In addition, they have a complex internal organization, with several organelles that perform specific functions. Understanding these structures is essential to comprehend how plants grow, develop, and interact with the environment.</p>

      <h2>Plant Cell Organelles</h2>

      <div class="org-item">
        <h3>Cell Wall</h3>
        <p>Rigid structure composed of cellulose that externally surrounds the plant cell. It provides protection, shape, and support, as well as controls the entry of water, preventing the cell from bursting. The cell wall also allows the plant to maintain its structure even in environments with humidity variations.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="org-item">
        <h3>Plasma Membrane</h3>
        <p>Thin and flexible layer that surrounds the cytoplasm. Composed of a lipid bilayer with proteins, it regulates the entry and exit of substances, maintaining the cell's internal balance. It acts as a selective barrier, allowing nutrients in and waste out.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="org-item">
        <h3>Cytoplasm</h3>
        <p>Internal region of the cell where all organelles are immersed. It is composed of cytosol, a liquid rich in proteins and ions, which serves as a medium for the essential chemical reactions of cellular life. The cytoplasm also helps in the movement of substances within the cell.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="org-item">
        <h3>Nucleus</h3>
        <p>The control center of the cell, where the DNA is located. The nucleus coordinates activities such as growth, reproduction, and protein synthesis. It is surrounded by a nuclear membrane with pores that regulate the exchange of substances with the cytoplasm.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="org-item">
        <h3>Central Vacuole</h3>
        <p>Large, fluid-filled structure that occupies much of the cell volume. Stores water, ions, pigments, and waste. It also helps with turgor pressure, which keeps the cell firm and contributes to the plant's support.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="org-item">
        <h3>Chloroplasts</h3>
        <p>Organelles responsible for photosynthesis. They contain chlorophyll, a green pigment that captures sunlight and transforms light energy into chemical energy. Chloroplasts have internal membranes called thylakoids, where light reactions occur, and also have their own DNA.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="org-item">
        <h3>Mitochondria</h3>
        <p>Known as the "powerhouses" of the cell, mitochondria produce ATP through cellular respiration. They use glucose and oxygen to generate the energy needed for cellular activities.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="org-item">
        <h3>Endoplasmic Reticulum</h3>
        <p>Network of channels that transports substances within the cell. The rough endoplasmic reticulum has ribosomes and participates in protein synthesis. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum acts in lipid production and cellular detoxification.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="org-item">
        <h3>Golgi Complex</h3>
        <p>Responsible for modifying, packaging, and distributing proteins and lipids. It participates in the formation of the cell wall and the vacuole, as well as in the secretion of substances outside the cell.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="org-item">
        <h3>Ribosomes</h3>
        <p>Structures responsible for protein synthesis. They can be free in the cytoplasm or attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. They are essential for cell growth and repair.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="org-item">
        <h3>Peroxisomes</h3>
        <p>Organelles that break down toxic substances, such as hydrogen peroxide, and participate in lipid metabolism. They help protect the cell against oxidative damage.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Work developed by Felipe Martins de Lima, Jhuan Martins Bueno, and Pedro Henrique Pereira Paiva, 1st year integrated in Informatics, for the Web Programming Language and Biology course. This content aims to clearly and organizedly present the main structures of the plant cell, highlighting their functions and importance for living beings, and to present our model.</p>
